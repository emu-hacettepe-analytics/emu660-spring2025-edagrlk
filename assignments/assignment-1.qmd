My first assignment has three parts.

## (b)  

# Exploring Statistical Summaries of ‘mtcars’ dataset

```{r}
data(mtcars)

compute_stats <- function(x) {
  c(
    mean = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    variance = var(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    IQR = IQR(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    min = min(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = max(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
}

result <- sapply(mtcars, compute_stats)

library(knitr)
kable(t(result), caption = "mtcars Data Set Summary")
```
