However, it reduces variability because all missing values are replaced with the same number.\n\nRandom imputation keeps the datasetâ€™s natural variety but introduces randomness, which may not always be ideal.\nChoosing the best method depends on the purpose of the analysis. If maintaining consistency is more important, median imputation is a better choice. If preserving the original distribution is a priority, random imputation is preferable.\n\nChoosing the right method depends on the data and what we want to achieve with it.",
